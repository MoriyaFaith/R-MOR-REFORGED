Great. A bunch of shitty items which add nothing to your run end up coming out of the <color=#E5C962>Chests</color> you buy. They get the benefit of your hard earned dosh that came from killing <style=cIsHealth>Lemurians</style>.\n\nAs a man who plays this game you are <style=cIsHealth>LITERALLY</style> dedicating two hours of your life to opening boxes and praying it's not another <color=#77FF16>Chronobauble</color>.
